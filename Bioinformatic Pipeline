De novo genome assembly for the naked mole-rat

A.	Download HetGla_female_1.0 & HetGla_1.0 naked mole-rat Illumina reads from the NCBI website: (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/?term=naked+mole-rat).

B.	Examine the quality of the raw reads using the software programme FastQC with in a Linux terminal.

C.	Trim poor quality Illumina reads/adapters by using the programme Trimmomatic with in the Linux terminal.
            (Note: Use the output files from the Trimmomatic tool for the next steps).

D.	Download and compile the ‘ABySS’, ‘Velvet’ and ‘SPAdes’ genome assembler(s) in the Linux terminal

E.	Assemble raw NMR sequencing reads into a draft genome assembly using each of the assemblers. Use the tool SSPACE to control the scaffolding process. SAM tools can be used for manipulating alignments in the SAM format.

F.	Examine the contiguity statists of the ‘new’ genome assemblies use tool SAMStat and compare them to the HetGla_female_1.0 (Keane et al, 2014) to see if real improvements have been made.

G.	Perform QUAST evaluation(s) of the new genomes to gauge the best and worst assemblies.
