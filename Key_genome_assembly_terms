Key Genome Assembly term

Coverage - The number of reads covering a particular position in the genome.

Contig - Contiguous piece of DNA sequence that have been assembled from more than one read.

N50 – the minimum contig length needed to cover 50% of the genome (A length weighted median that gives a more robust quality value than a simple median).

N10 – the minimum contig length needed to cover 10% of the genome. 

N90 – the minimum contig length needed to cover 90% of the genome. 

ORF - Open Reading Frame is a stretch of amino acids with no stop codon.

Scaffolding – the process of ordering and orientating contigs. Preferred way is based on assembling reads into contigs then using paired-end information to join them into scaffolds. 

Read – The unit of DNA sequence that comes from a sequencing instrument. 

Spanned gaps - Gaps that have linkage evidence (see NCBI AGP specification v2.1) also called within-scaffold gaps. 

Sequence length - Total length of all top-level sequences i.e. the most highly assembled sequences in an assembly. 

Ungapped length - Total length of all top-level sequences, Ignoring gaps. 10+ Ns in a sequence is treated like a gap, they occur due to ambiguous base calls.
